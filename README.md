# Personal Project - Darkest Dungeon Team Assembler

## What will the application do?

This application will allow users to create 
team setups for the game Darkest Dungeon. The 
user will be able to: 
- save and name their team setups
- add and remove characters from a team
- select skills for characters

Once a team is created, the user should 
also be able to see:
- the team's strongest qualities 
(*ex. lots of stuns*)
- the team's weaker qualities 
(*ex. no healing, no stuns*)
- the areas and bosses that the team will be 
strong and/or weak against
- the positions of the enemy team that the
player's team can hit

## Why is this project of interest to you? Who will use it?

I find that I'm a little forgetful when it comes to remembering 
good strategies and team compositions for certain areas 
and bosses within the game. I tend to spend a lot of time searching 
online for compositions that other people like to 
use as well as tips and tricks, and team setups are a pretty 
heavily-discussed topic within the game's community as 
well. A tool that could help me put characters together in a team, 
tell me the team's strengths and weaknesses, and also 
tell me where and what I should be fighting with this team would be 
really helpful, not just for me but maybe for people
who are newer to the game as well!
